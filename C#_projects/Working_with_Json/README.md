As part of this project, I worked with real data - data from the games "Cultist Simulator" and "Book Of Hours" developed by Weather Factory. 
We have received official permission to use their intellectual property for educational purposes. 
(This is also a project within the framework of studying at the Higher School of Economics). 
The program is a help system that, through the use of an on-screen menu and user dialogues, 
provides the ability to work with data presented in JSON format.
